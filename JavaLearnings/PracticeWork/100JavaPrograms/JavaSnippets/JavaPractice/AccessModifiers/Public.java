/*
 * A class, method, constructor, interface etc declared public can be accessed from any other class. Therefore fields, methods, blocks declared inside a
 * public class can be accessed from any class belonging to the Java Universe.
 * However if the public class we are trying to access is in a different package, then the public class still need to be imported. Because of class
 * inheritance, all public methods and variables of a class are inherited by its subclasses.
