 * Collection framework is an interface that implments that has iterable and has list, queue and set
 * These collection models are needs to store data in different formats as per requirement
 * There are mainly 3 types of Collections:
 * 1) Lists can multiple objects and duplicate objects as well. This maintains elements insertion order
 * 2) Queue follows FIFO principle
 * 3) Sets dont allow duplicate elements. This is used when ordering is not important
