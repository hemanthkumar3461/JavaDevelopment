/*3 types of variables
 * 
 *Local - Non static
 *instance - Non static
 *
 * static - static: when a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared across all objects in class levels
 *It is generally used to count the number of objects created
 *static is for class, it is shared across all objects in the class
 *
 *We can create static variable, class, method, block 
 *static is used as common property for all objects across the class
 *ID can be common across all objects over the class but not name, age and phone

/*
 * Local variables are defined in a block, method, constructor
 * instialisation of local varaibles is mandatory
 *  int k=5;

/*
 * Instance are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block
