package ObjectOrientedProgramming.Abstraction;

//If a class is declared abstract it may or may not have abstract methods
//Abstract class cant be instantiated but they can act like subclass, We cant make objects out of these classes
//Abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation
//There are abstract classes and abstract methods
//If any class atleast has one abstract method then the whole class should be made abstract
//Interfaces uses public static final for its fields and all interface methods are public 
//Abstract class can contain abstract method and non abstract method as well
//Abstract class must contain atleast one abstract method
//When to use abstract class and interfaces????
//In order to use abstract class you want to share code among several closely related classes
//If you want unrelated classes where u want to share code then u need to use interfaces

//When u have common code methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public 
//Interface- you want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior

//You want to declare non-static or non-static fields
//you want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.Interface use static and final fields

public interface AbstractClass {
